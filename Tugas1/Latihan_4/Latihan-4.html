    <h1>The 10 Most Popular Programming Language to Learn in 2022</h1>
    <p>There's no question that software programming is a hot career right now. The U.S. Bereau of Labor Statistics project 21 percent growth for
        programmming jobs from 2018 to 2028. Which is ore than four times for all occupations. What's more the media annual pay for a software programmer
        is about $106,000, which nearly three times the median pay for all U.S. workers.
    </p>
    <p>Not all programming jobs are the same, however. Different roles, companies, and types of software require knowing and understanding different programming languages
        --and it's ofte beneficial to know multiple languages. Trying to break into the field of software programming can be daunting experience, especially for professionals 
        with no prior programming experience.
    </p>
    <p>The <u>Master of Science in Computer Science Align program</u> at Northeastern University is specifically designed for students wh want to transition into computer 
        science from another field of study.
    </p>
    <p>"<i>Our aim is to transport  students from variety of different backgrounds and have them come out as software engineers,</i>" says Ian Gorton, PhD and director 
        of the graduate computer science programs at Northeastern University--Seattle,"<i>We focus o math, programming and a variety of computer science and engineering concepts</i>
        " Whether you're new to programming or looking to brush up on your skills, it helps to know which languages are in high demand. Here are 10 of the most popular programming
         languages of 2020 based on the number of job postings listed on job search site Indeed, the average annual salary for those jobs, and factors such as ease of use
        and potential for growth.
